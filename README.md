My application, called Kung'u Store, will follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere. 
I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, 
a shopping cart where users can add and remove products,
and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details. 
I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing the catalog,
and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.
